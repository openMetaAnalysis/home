openMetaAnalysis
==================

You may view and interact with and example meta-analysis at [this link] (https://public.opencpu.org/ocpu/github/openMetaAnalysis/home/www) at [OpenCPU] (https://public.opencpu.org)

Why put meta-analyses in this interactive, public format?
-----------------------------------------------------
###Problem:

1.    Meta-analyses become outdated, sometimes before they are published.(PMID: [17638714](http://pubmed.gov/17638714))
2.    Meta-analyses may overlap each other without coordination.(PMID: [23873947](http://pubmed.gov/23873947))

###Solution:
Collaborative and continuous meta-analysis, supported by open-source, cloud development. While wikis also offer a solution, they are reaching limits in their ability to represent complex knowledge.([details](http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/520446/the-decline-of-wikipedia/)) GitHub, originally developed for collaborative development of software, has been proposed as a method to publish legislative information with transparent tracking of development.([details](http://www.ted.com/talks/clay_shirky_how_the_internet_will_one_day_transform_government.html)) Likewise, GitHub can host medical knowledge, support team science(PMID: [18619407](http://pubmed.gov/18619407)), and provide collaboration beyond what is possible with wikis. GitHub transparently tracks updates to meta-analyses and provides links to related, alternative, or competing, analyses. Collaboration with GitHub complements the functions of open data repositories such as [DRYAD](http://datadryad.org/) and [YODA](http://medicine.yale.edu/core/projects/yodap/index.aspx). There is no reason an open meta-anlaysis should ever go out of date. Anyone can revise it or copy it to make alternative analyses. Similar to [wikigenes](https://www.wikigenes.org/), authors' contributions are tracked for academic credit.

###Example:
[Vitamin D for fracture prevention](https://github.com/openMetaAnalysis/Vitamin-D-for-fracture-prevention/blob/master/README.md).  We invite authors interested in vitamin D to revise and update this example of an open meta-analysis.
